## [0.19.1] — 2026-07-01 · horus-source 2.1.0

- `horus connect shopify` now asks **which auth model** you're using up front — *static Admin API token* or *Client-Credentials app* — and prompts only the fields that mode needs, instead of ambiguous optional fields. The credential is required: the wizard re-prompts on a blank secret and, as a general safety net, `horus connect` now **refuses to save any connector that's still missing a required field** (previously a Shopify connector could save with no token and wrongly report success). Secrets stay masked on input and in the summary, and encrypted at rest — unchanged.

## [0.19.0] — 2026-07-01 · horus-source 2.1.0

- New **Shopify Admin connector** — bring your store's data into investigations. `horus connect shopify` wires up a store with either a static Admin API access token or a Client-Credentials app (access id + secret, which Horus exchanges for a short-lived token automatically and refreshes); the store name is just the subdomain (`.myshopify.com` is added for you), and the secret is encrypted at rest like every other connector. The connector embeds **no queries**: you supply the Admin GraphQL query at investigation time (`horus investigate --shopify-query @orders.graphql`, a raw string, or `-` for stdin; repeatable, with `--shopify-variables`), or declare default `queries` in config for `horus watch`. The engine binds the investigation window into `$from`/`$to` when the query declares them and folds each result into the report as application-`state` evidence alongside logs, metrics, and code — surfaced in `horus status`, `horus doctor`, and `horus readiness`. Read-only.

## [0.18.0] — 2026-06-30 · horus-source 2.1.0

- **Go, Java, and Rust support.** Horus now indexes Go, Java, and Rust repositories (paired horus-source 2.1.0): functions/methods, structs/classes/records/enums, interfaces/traits, imports, call graphs, and heritage (Java `extends`/`implements`, Rust `impl Trait for Type`); Spring annotations feed entrypoint detection. Verified end-to-end on real OSS repos. (HOR-459, HOR-460, HOR-461)
- **Sharper causes when nothing is linked to the seed.** When no runtime error is structurally tied to the implicated code, investigations now surface a symptom-matching runtime signal — a warn-level event whose code names the symptom (e.g. `SALE_028` "Sale with link not found" for "sale links broken") — as a hedged cause ranked above a speculative deployment guess, instead of defaulting to "a recent commit may have caused this". Precision-gated so a loud unrelated warning can't false-match. On a live tenant's eval set this lifted headline accuracy from ~28% to ~57% with no false fires. (HOR-453)
- Internal: the horus-source backend is now also vendored into the monorepo (`packages/source-py`) with its own CI, the first step toward a single-repo/single-release setup. No user-facing change. (HOR-450)

## [0.17.1] — 2026-06-30 · horus-source 2.0.2

- New `horus notify` command to configure the watch outbound sink (0.17.0) without hand-editing config: `horus notify set --url <webhook> [--secret <s>] [--min-confidence 0.6] [--cloud]`, plus `show`, `test` (sends a sample dispatch to verify the webhook), and `remove`. The webhook signing secret is stored encrypted in `.horus/secrets.local.json` (never plaintext in config), consistent with connector-secret encryption. (HOR-454)

## [0.17.0] — 2026-06-30 · horus-source 2.0.2

- `horus watch` can now NOTIFY you. When it auto-investigates a new incident and the result clears a confidence threshold, it dispatches the one-line cause to a configured outbound sink — a generic webhook (Slack-compatible JSON, HMAC-signed with `X-Horus-Signature` when you set a secret) and/or a Horus Cloud push. Configure per environment: `environments[].notify: { minConfidence, webhook: { url, secret }, cloud }`. Best-effort and resilient — a failed dispatch is logged and the watch loop keeps running. No daemon; `watch` stays a poller. (HOR-454)

## [0.16.1] — 2026-06-30 · horus-source 2.0.2

- A broad, sweeping commit (e.g. a large integration touching dozens of files) that merely *included* the implicated file is no longer presented as the confident root cause of an unrelated symptom. When the most-focused recent change touching that file is still broad and nothing else corroborates it, the investigation now says "No specific cause identified from the available evidence — a broad recent change touched this file but isn't clearly linked; connect runtime evidence for a code-aware cause" instead of naming the commit. (HOR-451)

## [0.16.0] — 2026-06-30 · horus-source 2.0.2

- Connector credentials are now **encrypted at rest**. Tokens, passwords and connection URLs are AES-256-GCM encrypted into a gitignored `.horus/secrets.local.json`, with the 32-byte master key held by your OS keychain (macOS Keychain, Linux libsecret, Windows DPAPI) — never the repo (`HORUS_SECRET_KEY` overrides for CI/headless). `config.json` keeps only non-secret fields and stays safe to share. New `horus secrets status|migrate|key`, and `horus doctor` now warns when `.horus/` isn't gitignored or config still holds a plaintext secret. Backward-compatible — existing plaintext config still resolves. (HOR-452)
- More trustworthy root causes on real systems (from live connector dogfooding). A recent commit that only touched documentation or reformatted code is no longer blamed as a regression; a broad, diffuse commit that merely touched the implicated file is down-weighted so an evidence-backed runtime cause isn't outranked by it; and an informational/diagnostic log signal can no longer be presented as a confident root cause. (HOR-451)

## [0.15.2] — 2026-06-30 · horus-source 2.0.2

- The source-only data-flow cause (0.15.0) now looks one hop out from the seed — the function it calls or a closely-related function — so it can name a mechanism that lives in a reducer, a library helper, or a sibling method rather than only the entry point. Also recognizes an exact-equality database lookup with no normalization (a value that differs only in case/whitespace returns no rows) as a candidate cause. Still hedged and source-only; never outranks a genuine evidence-backed cause. (HOR-448)

## [0.15.1] — 2026-06-30 · horus-source 2.0.2

- More accurate localization on TypeScript/GraphQL apps. Investigations no longer anchor on auto-generated code (e.g. a `Cart` type in `graphql/generated.tsx`) or other type declarations when a real function with the same name exists — the actual implementation (`cartReducer`, a service method, …) is now chosen as the seed, which also lets the source-only data-flow cause (0.15.0) read the right code. A type you explicitly point at still surfaces. (HOR-447)

## [0.15.0] — 2026-06-30 · horus-source 2.0.2

- Sharper root causes without runtime data. When investigating with no logs/metrics connected, Horus now reads the implicated function's own code and proposes a concrete mechanism — a fixed polling cadence, an in-place state mutation, an unawaited async write, or a hardcoded threshold/retry limit (incl. reference-equality bail-outs) — instead of always falling back to "a recent commit may have caused this". It stays a hedged, clearly-source-only suggestion ("verify against runtime evidence") that never outranks a genuine, evidence-backed cause. (HOR-446)

## [0.14.1] — 2026-06-30 · horus-source 2.0.2

- Fixed: `horus investigate` no longer aborts when a source query fails on an unusual symbol. A seed that resolved to a `#private` class method made the impact lookup 404 (the `#` truncated the request URL), and the whole investigation exited with an error. The symbol id is now encoded correctly, and a failed impact/flows query degrades gracefully (no blast-radius evidence) instead of sinking the run. (HOR-445)

## [0.14.0] — 2026-06-30 · horus-source 2.0.2

- Horus can now LEARN from your feedback. A local, per-tenant reranker (`horus train`) fits on your own outcome-label corpus and reorders candidate causes so the right one surfaces more often — measured honestly against a held-out baseline. It is a ranking aid only: it reorders among causes that already clear Horus's confidence gates and never changes a score, a confidence, or a verdict. Your corpus never leaves your machine; it ships OFF and trains nothing until the corpus is large enough to beat the baseline, then you enable a proven model with `HORUS_RERANK=1`. (HOR-404)

## [0.13.2] — 2026-06-30 · horus-source 2.0.2

- Feedback at the right moment: instead of asking right after an investigation (before you know if Horus was right), Horus now nudges you once on a later run to label a prior investigation that's still unresolved — rate-limited, dismissible, and never in scripts/CI (`--no-input` / `HORUS_NO_INPUT` to disable). This raises the outcome-label rate that powers Horus's measured accuracy over time. (HOR-431)

## [0.13.1] — 2026-06-30 · horus-source 2.0.2

- The `horus report` bug/gap path is now fully discoverable: an unexpected crash nudges you to file an issue, and the command is documented in the CLI reference. Completes the surfacing for the reporting path. (HOR-439)

## [0.13.0] — 2026-06-29 · horus-source 2.0.2

- Benign-variance from code alone: when a service splits its work per segment — separate per-market/region/tenant queues, or a dispatcher like `manageSalesForMarket(market)` fanned out per market — Horus now recognizes the natural per-segment duration variance directly from the code, with no telemetry required, so an expected artifact is no longer reported as a confident wrong root cause. (HOR-438)
- `horus feedback` no longer needs an investigation id — it defaults to your most recent investigation, and a footer after each investigation nudges you to correct a wrong cause. (HOR-431)
- New `horus report [hint]` command and `report_issue` MCP tool: file a Horus bug or capability gap as a pre-filled GitHub issue with an environment block (CLI + source version, OS, Node). Agents can report gaps they hit mid-task. No auth, nothing sent automatically. (HOR-439)
- When the CLI and source-intelligence backend versions drift, the version-pin guard now points you to `horus update` to realign. (HOR-436)

## [0.12.5] — 2026-06-29

- `horus doctor` now health-checks every configured connector, not just the first — misconfigured integrations surface up front. (HOR-437)

## [0.12.4] — 2026-06-29

- Investigations no longer over-anchor on an alert's suggested cause: alert-suggested causes are de-anchored, confidence is recalibrated, and a benign-variance hypothesis is weighed so an expected fluctuation isn't promoted to a confident root cause. (HOR-435)
- Duration-anomaly investigations get real distribution signal: runtime logs are grouped by dimension/region and bimodal (two-population) metrics are detected. (HOR-434)

## [0.12.3] — 2026-06-29 · horus-source 2.0.2

- Self-healing upgrades: upgrading from a pre-2.0 (KuzuDB-era) install now auto-recovers — a legacy or zero-embedding index is detected on host start and re-extracted + re-embedded automatically, no manual reset. (HOR-433)
- Each investigation records a context-only memory; recurring incidents consolidate into a single item with a recurrence count. (HOR-432)

## [0.12.2] — 2026-06-28 · horus-source 2.0.1

- Improved investigation accuracy: seed ranking now weights semantic similarity above raw keyword matching, so investigations surface real core code instead of same-named example/test/demo symbols. (HOR-430)

## [0.12.1] — 2026-06-28

- Fixed: `horus stop` reliably stops its own source host even after an automatic port fallback.
- Docs: README refreshed.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-06-28 · horus-source 2.0.0

- Storage engine rewrite: source-intelligence storage migrated from KuzuDB to SQLite + sqlite-vec (+ FTS5). Lighter install, EOL KuzuDB dependency retired, re-index automatic on upgrade. KuzuDB stays opt-in via `HORUS_SOURCE_STORAGE_BACKEND=kuzu` + the `[kuzu]` extra through the 2.x line, and will be removed in horus-source 3.0.0. (Major: horus-source 2.0.0.)

## [0.11.0] — 2026-06-28

- Axiom connector: `horus connect axiom` (token, region, live dataset pick); Axiom logs flow into investigations as evidence with provenance.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-06-28 · horus-source 1.6.1

- Quality + knowledge graph: interactive Knowledge Graph (Explore + Timeline), Evidence-v2 (subject + typed findings), per-investigation Provenance view, per-tenant accuracy / Insights, and the memory-to-memory link graph (supersedes / contradicts / recurs-with). Plus a large batch of investigation-quality fixes from dogfooding on 50+ real repositories.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-28

- Memory + dashboard: the memory system (capture / recall / confirm), the eval/outcome store, self-routing investigations, and the cloud dashboard.

## [0.8.x] — 2026-06-24 to 2026-06-27

- Hardening: dogfood-driven fixes and connector hardening across many real repositories.

## [0.1.0–0.7.0] — 2026-06-17 to 2026-06-23

- Initial development: the core investigation engine, source intelligence, the first connectors, and the CLI foundations.
