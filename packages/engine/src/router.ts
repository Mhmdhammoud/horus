/**
 * HOR-386 — the shared, deterministic next-step router.
 *
 * A PURE module: no IO, no LLM, no command execution. Given a command + the conditions
 * the engine/surfaces already computed, it returns an ordered `RouteStep[]` of suggested
 * next commands. Adding a route = adding one table entry below.
 *
 * Honesty invariants (see spec §5):
 *   - Suggests, never runs. A `RouteStep` is advisory data only.
 *   - Never fabricates. Every `nextTool` is a REAL shipped command (`index`, `search`,
 *     `blast-radius`, `explain`, `connect <supported-type>`, `readiness`, `investigate`,
 *     `what-changed`, `owner`, `logs`, `metrics`, `queues`) or a real MCP knowledge tool
 *     (`search_project_knowledge`). There is NO `connect tracing`/`connect source` — those
 *     connectors do not exist in `connect.ts` (SUPPORTED = elasticsearch/mongodb/postgres/
 *     sentry/axiom/shopify/grafana/redis), so no rule emits them; the `traces` gap carries no `routeHint`.
 *   - Deterministic. Each rule fires on a known boolean/enum condition; same input ⇒ same
 *     output, byte-stable for snapshots. No probabilistic ranking, no generated prose.
