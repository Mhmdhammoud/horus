"""Hybrid search combining full-text and vector search via Reciprocal Rank Fusion.

Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) merges ranked lists from different retrieval
systems into a single ranking.  Each document receives a score::

    RRF_score(d) = sum_r  weight_r / (k + rank_r(d))

where *k* is a smoothing constant (default 60) that prevents high-ranked items
from dominating, *rank_r(d)* is the 1-based position of document *d* in ranker
*r*'s result list, and *weight_r* scales that ranker's contribution.
