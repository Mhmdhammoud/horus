/**
 * HOR-319 (Bug 2) — self-heal a down source-intelligence host.
 *
 * `horus investigate` used to exit 1 the moment `code.health()` failed. Instead we try
 * to restart a previously-indexed host at its configured port before giving up, so a
 * transient host outage degrades into a brief auto-start rather than a dead end.
 *
 * This composes the canonical host-lifecycle primitives owned by HOR-SOURCE
 * (@horus/connectors) — it does NOT reimplement host management, and it never performs
 * first-time analysis (that remains the job of `horus index`).
