# HOR-17 — product-level acceptance test for Horus (revalidated under the
# project/environment-scoped model, HOR-34, with ES error-signature evidence
# (HOR-10) and MongoDB state evidence (HOR-33)).
#
# Replays the "Zoho sync delays" incident against the live leadcall-api/production
# environment (Axon :8420 + Elasticsearch leadcall-api-prod-* + Postgres :5433)
# and asserts the investigation surfaces the expected structure. Exits non-zero
# if any expectation regresses.
#
# Prereqs: `axon host --port 8420` inside leadcall-api, `docker compose up -d`,
# `pnpm build`, and runtime creds in ~/.horus.env (ES_URL/ES_USERNAME/ES_PASSWORD).
